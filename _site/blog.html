      <p>Infra is one of the most host topics in the Software development these days. There are so many tools,
so much to learn that very few people actually know what to do and what the best practises. Everyone wants
to jump on the microservice bandwagon. However, it’s not as easy as it seems. I medidated quite a bit on this
and have come up with these points that I think are maybe some good to follow tips:</p>

      <p>We are a big fan of tools. We use them daily in almost everything, but at one point in time, they pollute our mental space so much that we just forget to think and do as the tools dictate. A common example could be smart-phone. It was meant to keep us mobile and connected but now, it has become so dominant and addictive that it is more of a bane than boon.</p>

      <p>Software Engineering comes with a lot of good learning opportunities. First you learn
how to write something by reading tutorials, watching videos etc, Then down the time you learn
some new ways to do the same thing and you are blown by it. But only after some days you actually encounter
the real hard problem in Computer Science. Some of them are:</p>

      <p>I joined github in 2010 and it has been my primary source for reading and writing code. I took my baby steps doing open source programming reading others code and it has been a  good source of knowledge for me. Since then I have written quite some open source software. I have written some javascript, python and go code and shared those projects in github. Open Source has quite some good benefits as it gives you a nice place to hack on things that fancy your imagination.</p>

It was so much fun. Next, It was GW Basic, then Java and then C/C++/Python. I have been writing code professionally for 5 years now

interviewed for my current company and was offered to join them in Feb

But I didn’t wanted to just sit alone at home and work. So I joined

There are lots of APIs to learn and there are quite a few security restrictions. 
Also, there is only one language that you can use to develop it i.e JavaScript.</p>

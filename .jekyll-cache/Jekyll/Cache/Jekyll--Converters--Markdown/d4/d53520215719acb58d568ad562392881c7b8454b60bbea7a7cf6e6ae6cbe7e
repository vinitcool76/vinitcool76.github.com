I"¹<p>I started programming JavaScript seriously in September 2012 and 
i never ever wondered that it will affect my life so much. 
Well, it started with me working on developing a Chrome Extension for a 
E-commerce/Social media app. Chrome is quite different for development. 
There are lots of APIs to learn and there are quite a few security restrictions. 
Also, there is only one language that you can use to develop it i.e JavaScript.</p>

I"<p>Time management is a key quality of any successful person. I have been working
pretty hard these days to improve me efficiency. Today, I have decided to
follow this pattern while at work.</p>

<p>Here is the breakdown. Letâ€™s assume the net hour spent at work is 8.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>50% Time (4 hrs) - Writing Code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>5% Time (24 min) - Documentation of the Code I wrote.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>5% time (24 min) - Writing test on the Code I wrote.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>10% time (48 min) - QA and testing the work I produced.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>20% time (96 min) - Planning and Studying about the topic I need to work on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>5% Time (24 mins) - Working with colleagues and helping out in case they need
any assistance.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I felt the need to this timetable because it is really necessary to control
the time when you are on tight deadlines. I like giving my all to the work and
definitely have very limited time to execute that. So only if my planning and
time management is solid I would be able to produce quality work on time.</p>

<p>I will produce a analysis of how this goes and how much success I achieve using
this methodology. Also, today I have completed my 41 day streak at GitHub.</p>

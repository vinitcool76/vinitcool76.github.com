I"…<p>I started programming JavaScript seriously in September 2012 and 
i never ever wondered that it will affect my life so much. 
Well, it started with me working on developing a Chrome Extension for a 
E-commerce/Social media app. Chrome is quite different for development. 
There are lots of APIs to learn and there are quite a few security restrictions. 
Also, there is only one language that you can use to develop it i.e JavaScript.</p>

<p>There are quite a few things i learned programming JavaScript:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Think before you code, think about the whole problem at once.</li>
  <li>Keep code clean and use modular structure.</li>
  <li>Use Linting and follow good guidelines given by experts.</li>
  <li>Read some good books and be aware of what you are into.</li>
</ul>

<p>Today i work as a Software Developer at an awesome Dutch startup <a href="http://changer.nl">Changer</a>.</p>

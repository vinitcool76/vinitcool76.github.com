I"<p>Today, I am completing 6 years of my full time employment with <a href="https://socialschools.nl">Socialschools</a>. It has been an incredibly long time and there has been highs and lows but mostly it has been a great experience writing code and having fun while doing it. I am very proud of the product I have helped build and make it succeed.</p>

<p>There are various factor that led me stay with this company for this long:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>People</strong>: I was lucky enough to be working with the best people who are friendly, empathetic and have impeccable professionalism.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Work Life Balance</strong>: People realize that everyone has a life outside the work and respect that.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Quality of Work</strong>: I have been very lucky in being able to work on very hard problems and solve them. This doesnâ€™t happen too often with many companies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Trust</strong>: You are more motivated to do things in the best possible way when your teammates trust you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ownership</strong>: You are given ownership of a part of product and people trust you that you will make the best possible decision for it and the team.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Nobody can look very far in the future and say what they are going to do but at this point of time, I feel incredibly lucky and full of gratitude to everyone who has played a part in my journey.</p>

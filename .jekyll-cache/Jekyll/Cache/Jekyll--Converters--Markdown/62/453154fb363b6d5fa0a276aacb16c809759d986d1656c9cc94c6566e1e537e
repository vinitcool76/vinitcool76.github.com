I"ª<p>Last few months has been really exciting for me. Since, i joined <a href="http://changer.nl">Changer</a> on 1st February.
Here are some things i learnt in these 5 months:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I should try to learn and own the stack i am  working on. Trying to do a lot of things at a time is not going to help much.</li>
  <li>Contributing a lot to open source is a good thing and i am lucky my company encourages me to do so.</li>
  <li>I should write a lot of code and read a lot more. i should invest time in learning and understanding my product.</li>
  <li>I should think about code quality and maintainability before i write a single line of code. It is tough things to get right at first, but with hard work i could achieve this.</li>
  <li>Having good understanding and relationship with the people i daily work with is important. It is must to have a smile on my face.</li>
  <li>I must have fun with what i do. Period!</li>
</ul>

I"<p>Work has a really important role in anyone’s life. I feel there are some things that really help us
do our work nicely.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Arrive on time. Don’t be late without giving a heads up to the other party.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Think logically before making any decision.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keep the communication lines open.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are facing a difficulty admit it, don’t let your ego come in between.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are always things that could be difficult, persistent hard work is the only way to crack them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t fall victim of easy goals, work with full passion on whatever you have decided.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t think much about other things, just concentrate on your work.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="most-important-things">Most important things:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>No work is too small, everything teaches you something new.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Life is too small to waste on useless arguments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keep your mouth shut when you don’t have something useful to contribute.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Read books, improve your skills.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Challenge your limits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Read well, write well.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

I"¾<p>I have been writing my resume in LaTeX for more than a decade now. Writing your resume in LaTex has itâ€™s own benefits.

</ul>

<p>Now, writing your resume in all LaTex is all well and good but converting it into pdf on macOS is a task on itâ€™s own. The MacTeX package is a BIG download of around 6GB and itâ€™s not worth spending so much time and energy for only trying to convert your resume from LaTex to PDF. Well, you can ofcourse use one of the online latex-to-pdf converter or you can install the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">basictex</code> package and set your local mac environment capable of converting to PDF.</p>

<p>Follow these steps to get it working:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># install basictex using brew #NOTE your password might be required
brew cask install basictex
# try to install texlivefly, it complains about tlmgr outdated
sudo tlmgr install texliveonfly
# update tlmgr
sudo tlmgr update --self
# now install textliveonfly
sudo tlmgr install texliveonfly

# use the commands using sudo.
# for eg: if your resume file name is vinit_kumar.tex

sudo texliveonfly vinit_kumar.tex

# this outputs a file named vinit_kumar.pdf in the same directory
# now, open this file like this to check if all your changes made it through.

open vinit_kumar.pdf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The idea came from this website, though the issue was it was not working without <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo</code>. Hence, wrote this post more of an reminder of how to get LaTex to PDF working on macOS</p>

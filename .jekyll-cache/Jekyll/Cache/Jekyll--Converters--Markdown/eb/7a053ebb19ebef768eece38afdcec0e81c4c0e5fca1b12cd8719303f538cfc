I"<<p>After a lot of meditation about what I have achieved in last one year, I have stumbled upon one fact. I need to hack
a lot more on Python and JavaScript. These are two main languages I am comfortable with and almost all my projects
and official work is done with them.</p>

<p>Well, here are some small ideas about how I am going to achieve this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Read a lot of Good code. I will spend at least 1 hour everyday reading some really awesome python code.</li>
  <li>Write a lot of commonly used utilities in Python. For example: Automate at least one of the task I daily do using Python.</li>
  <li>Read Django Documentation and toy with it.</li>
  <li>Write PEP8 compliant code.</li>
</ul>

<p>These were the ideas for Python, Now for JavaScript:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Give a solid foundation to my understanding of prototypical inheritance in JavaScript.</li>
  <li>Write a lot of Backbone and some really good jQuery Code.</li>
  <li>Read some really good code and write some coffeeScript as well.</li>
  <li>Learn writing good unit tests in Jasmine and Mocha.</li>
</ul>

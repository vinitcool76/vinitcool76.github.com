I"þ<p>Maintaining and contributing to an Open Source Project is a very important part of a developers life. 
Luckily, i am in a Company that gives me full liberty to contribute and in fact we have a 
Open Source day(Friday) where we could open source reusable components of project 
we have been working on to the open source audience.</p>

<p>This is plain awesome, because not only it encourages a healthy culture of giving back 
to the community, also it improves the overall quality of the project as you just do not open source 
anything without getting it better.</p>

<p>With that said, I have open sourced two of my projects:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/vinitcool76/cmsplugin-fbalbum">cmsplugin-fbalbum</a>:</p>

<p>This is a django-cms plugin that gives the end user to showcase the photos 
from their Facebook album without going through any code. Just enter the album
name, album URL and access-token and you are good to go.
It is also available to everyone on pypi, In order to install just do:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip install cmsplugin-fbalbum
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It is under heavy development and still in beta, but can be used. Any sort of contribution is welcome.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/vinitcool76/googlecl">googlecl</a>:</p>

<p>It is another dear project of mine, it was previously being developed 
by Google Engineer, Tom.H.Miller. Since he is quite busy nowadays and could not contribute actively, 
I have decided to maintain this project on GitHub and add features/bugfixes and refactoring.</p>

<p>I am happy to have these two projects in progress and will open source
more of my stuff in future. Though i regret not blogging that often these days.</p>

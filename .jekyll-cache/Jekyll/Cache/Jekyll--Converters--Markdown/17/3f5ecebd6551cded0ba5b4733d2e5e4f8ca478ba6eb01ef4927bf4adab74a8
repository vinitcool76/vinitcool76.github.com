I"I<p>I recently read a blog by Jeff Atwood that there is no such people as Rock-star programmer.These are people who could write cleaner code, refactor faster than anyone else, write a lot of tested code and methodology. This means each of one has a scope to get better as a developer.</p>

<p>I am in my first software development job and there is a lot of scope for me to improve and get better.</p>

<p>Obviously this is not going to happen overnight and i need to work hard to achieve this.</p>

<p>Here is my plan:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For JS server side read Madhu’s code and learn.</li>
  <li>For JS client side read Ruben’s code and learn.</li>
  <li>For Python read code from good projects like django.</li>
  <li>Write loads of code in NOSQL goodness(MongoDB).</li>
  <li>Incorporate good software development practices.</li>
  <li>Have a good foundation with algorithms and space-time complexity.</li>
  <li>Acquire a good grasp at the theoretical aspects of JavaScript and Python.</li>
  <li>Write a lot of tested and RESTFul APIs.</li>
  <li>Write tonnes of open source software.</li>
  <li>Spend an hour at IRC everyday.</li>
  <li>Work on a crazy project that is impossible to achieve.</li>
  <li>Work more on Automation and deployments.</li>
  <li>Estimate, organize and plan my work well in advance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, these are kind of my strict TODO list. At this moment, i think i have a decent understanding of technology and software development process. But, i am far from being a really good developer. There are loads of things to learn and i am really excited about the process.</p>

I"ï<p>Last few months has been really great for me. I think i am starting to grow as a developer and I know now 
how important is to keep performing at a certain level. The change started occurring when i gave up my 
comfort zone and started doing front-end mainly.It was a bit difficult in beginning to understand a design
from a designerâ€™s perspective and to convert it into running efficient code.</p>

<p>I also know now that everything is important and every contribution you do in a company is worthwhile and 
it is worth putting all your energy in doing whatever you are doing.</p>

<p>Now, i am looking forward to get expert level knowledge in whatever stack/technology i get to work on.
One need to be always learning and improving. I am definitely more focussed now and my goal is to do some really 
nice work on the products i work on.</p>

<p>Recently, i made the main website of your product <a href="http://www.socialschools.nl/en/">Socialschools</a> with my very 
talented designer colleague Robert. It was real fun converting his great design into pixel perfect and functional website.
I enjoy writing every line of code that i get to code because this is what i love to code.</p>

<p>P.S. I am a Civil Engineer by education, but have always loved computer so naturally was inclined to write softwares.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s it for now. Will post more about it later sometimes. You can follow the latest on twitter

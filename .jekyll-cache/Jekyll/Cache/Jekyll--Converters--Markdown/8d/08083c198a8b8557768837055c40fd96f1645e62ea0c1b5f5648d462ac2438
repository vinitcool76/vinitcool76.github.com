I"\<p>As humans, I think it is pretty important that we sometimes look deep into the soul and see what defines us
and what is the value-system we believe in.</p>

<p>Here are values I believe in. Remember this is not an all exhaustive list and I might update it later.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Spread love, not hate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Empathy is a very important quality.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not engage in useless arguments, name calling, trolling.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Life is too short to stay angry on anyone or anything for too long.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be punctual and respect otherâ€™s time as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not reply in haste, especially when you are angry.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be easy on yourself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Life is one of the greatest gifts, value it, cherish it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Smile often, care about those around you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Never leave an opportunity for a random act of kindness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surround yourself with what you love and block all negativity that bothers you.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

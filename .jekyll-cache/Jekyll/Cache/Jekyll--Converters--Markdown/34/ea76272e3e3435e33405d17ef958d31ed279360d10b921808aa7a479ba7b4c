I"¤<p>In last couple of days, i noticed there was no good planning for my personal projects and there were lots of loose ends. So i finally cleaned up my Github.</p>

<p>Here are some of ground rules for projects on Github:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Donâ€™t open source a project until the project has got unit test, wikis and sample application (if it is a application project) hosted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Integrate CI like travis and jenkins with all of them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do all the immature , experimental projects on Bitbucket.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write good, clean , pragmatic code in the projects on Github.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Look for bugs and spend more time on projects seriously.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Strictly follow Git-Flow on all your projects.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Blog about your latest work or maintain the wiki for the project every work. At the end of week review your work.</p>

I"`<p>Today, I am completing 6 years of my full time employment with <a href="https://socialschools.nl">Socialschools</a>. It has been an incredibly long time and there has been highs and lows but mostly it has been a great experience writing code and having fun while doing it. I am very proud of the product I have helped build and make it succeed.</p>

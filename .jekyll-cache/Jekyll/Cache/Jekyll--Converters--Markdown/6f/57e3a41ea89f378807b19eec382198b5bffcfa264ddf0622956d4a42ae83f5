I"·<p>2013 is easily one of the most amazing year of my life. In January I
interviewed for my current company and was offered to join them in Feb
which I did. Well a lot did happen after that. It was my first Full Time
job. I used to freelance as a Web/App Developer before which was fun.
But I didnâ€™t wanted to just sit alone at home and work. So I joined
Changer precisely 11 months and the journey is nothing short of
extraordinary.</p>

I"*<p>I think I was hardly 10 years old when I wrote my first line of code. It was probably some IBM PC and the language was LOGO. 
It was so much fun. Next, It was GW Basic, then Java and then C/C++/Python. I have been writing code professionally for 5 years now 
and I still enjoy writing code.</p>

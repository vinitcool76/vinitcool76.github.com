I"<p>A lot of things have changed recently. I converted from a hardcore Linux user 
to Mac lover. I got a high end Macbook from Office.</p>

<p>There are quite some reasons for my fondness with mac :</p>

<ul>
  <li>The OS X is quite good and amazingly stable.</li>
  <li>UI and UX is quite good once you get used to it.</li>
  <li>Almost every applications and tools under the sun is available to you.</li>
  <li>No messing up with hardwares, just connect and play.</li>
  <li>Awesome battery life, i could easily get 8 hours battery backup with this sweet machine.</li>
  <li>13-inch is an awesome form factor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, i recently got myself a HTC Desire X Android Smart phone. 
It is a lovely piece of hardware. Not big or bulky. At 4-inch screen
i have enough screen estate to do whatever i can do. Camera is good as well.
All together i am quite satisfied with my phone. Did i mention Beats Audio? 
It is an excellent addition to my phone. I spend quite some time traveling 
to office and it seems to be a great feeling to listen to music while traveling.</p>

<p>Though i still love my 2 year old dell and Nokia E5. 
Some repair and polishing is required and i will sure give them their due in right time.</p>

<p>I love my hardware and doesnâ€™t everyone else does too.</p>

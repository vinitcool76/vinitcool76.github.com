<p>Sometimes, your mac  is filled up with files and you canâ€™t seem to
understand what really is taking much space. Here is how you can find out.</p>

<ul>
  <li>First of all  find disk usage and save it to a log file. Also, find all
big files that are there. Grepping  using â€˜Gâ€™ would find all files that are  in
GB.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, save the second list to another file so that we are only doing it once.</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">du</span> <span class="nt">-h</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> ~/space.log
<span class="nb">cat</span> ~/space.log | <span class="nb">awk</span> <span class="s1">'{print $1}'</span> | <span class="nb">grep</span> <span class="s1">'G'</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span>  ~/highspace.log
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next,  open a split window and do</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cat</span> ~/highspace.log
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And Now, start finding the ones which are big one by one.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s say one of the entry was 5.6G, Letâ€™s find which one was it.</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="nb">cat</span> ~/space.log | fgrep <span class="nt">-f</span> highspace.log
 
 <span class="c">#It will give something like this:</span>
 
1.2G	./.android/avd/Nexus_6_API_21.avd
2.7G	./.android/avd
2.7G	./.android
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, if you feel the file is not needed and you want to delete it. Do the
following:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo rm</span> <span class="nt">-rf</span> Documents/Movie.avi
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Voila! Repeat this process and remove all files and directories that you  no
longer need.</p>

I"è<p>In the span of two days I have ordered three books:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Art of Computer Programming (Volume 1, 2 and 3)</li>
  <li>SICP</li>
  <li>The Art of Readable code</li>
</ul>

<p>These are considered best book in Computer Science and I am waiting eagerly
to lay my hands on them. I will also need to brush up my mathematics.</p>

<p>Well, AOCP is considered the toughest book to understand so my plan is
to keep reading it slowly and steadily. But I would like to complete
TARC and SICP in the coming 6 months.</p>

<p>For solving the exercise in SICP, I would use Clojure since it is the
new hotness and runs on JVM. For TARC, I would be using my main
programming language I code at work and work( Python and JavaScript).</p>

<p>I hope the coming months to be exciting and informative. It is said that
some decisions impact your life in a great manner and I would like this
to be one of them.</p>

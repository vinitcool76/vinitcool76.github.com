I"Ü<p>I joined Changer on Feb 2013. Today I completed my first year at full time employment. It has been nothing but amazing.</p>

<p>As I get to understand, first year is the toughest. It is hard to adjust working with people, communicating properly and keeping your mind sane
in lows and highs.</p>

<p>I am very proud of the hard work I put in my projects. I did some mistakes, improved a lot as a person and a programmer.I am totally committed 
to try harder and do things right in the first time.</p>

<p>Last but not the least, I would like to thank my parents, my girlfriend and my colleagues for being super supportive and nice during this time. 
I promise, I will make everyone very proud soon. :) :satisfied: @vinitkumar</p>

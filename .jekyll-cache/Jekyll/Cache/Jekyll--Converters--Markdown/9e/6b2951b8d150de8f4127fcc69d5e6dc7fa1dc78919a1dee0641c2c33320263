I"Ÿ<p>I am doing The Setup interview for myself. It is basically based on these four questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Who are you and what do you do?</li>
  <li>What hardware do you use?</li>
  <li>And what software?</li>
  <li>What would be your dream setup?</li>
</ul>

<p>So here it goes:</p>

<h3 id="who-are-you-and-what-do-you-do">Who are you and what do you do?</h3>

<p>Hello, I am Vinit and work as a software developer at this awesome Dutch startup,<a href="http://changer.nl">Changer</a>. I mostly write code in JavaScript and Python.</p>

<h3 id="what-hardware-do-you-use">What hardware do you use?</h3>

<p>I use a Macbook Pro, Mid 2009, with 8 GB Ram and 256 GB SSD. I use
30-inch BenQ Monitors, apple wired keyboard, Logitech GT400 at work. 
At home, I have a 22-inch Dell monitor with same keyboard and mouse. I
use Steelseries Headphones for listening to Music.
For storage and backups, I use a Western Digital 512GB Hard disk.</p>

<p>I also have an old Dell laptop with Windows7 and Ubuntu on it.</p>

<p>I have a HTC Desire X as my headphone with Android Jelly Bean. I like
this phone a lot and it does almost everything I required without burning
a hole in my pocket.</p>

<h3 id="and-what-software">And What Software?</h3>

<p>I use OS X Mavericks as my primary operating system.<br />
Well here is the list of Software I use:</p>

<p>For writing code, I only use Macvim. For browsing I use Chrome, firefox,
safari and IE (for testing mostly on VM). For running other OSes I use
Virtualbox.</p>

<p>I love <a href="http://kapeli.com/dash">Dash</a>. They are really awesome way to
read documentation of various stacks.</p>

<p>For tweeting I use default twitter client on both mac and android. I
think they are pretty good.</p>

<p>For music, iTunes suffices though I do listen to Winamp too.</p>

<p>My shell consists of a highly optimised Zsh configuration. For Django
related work I use PG Commander to view databases. For time tracking I
like toggl(https://www.toggl.com/).</p>

<h3 id="what-would-be-your-dream-setup">What would be your dream setup?</h3>

<p>My dream setup would be couple of Big 30-inch monitors. I would also
love a room with library and a nice dark corner to work.</p>

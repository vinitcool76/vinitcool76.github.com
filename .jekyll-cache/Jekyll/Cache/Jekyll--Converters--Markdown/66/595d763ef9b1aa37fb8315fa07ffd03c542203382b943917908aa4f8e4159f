I"&<p>So this week, I wrote a new theme for my blog. One big reason was that
using theme created by others were not fitting my needs and I was not
inspired to write anymore. This was odd because in general I love
writing posts on my blog.</p>

<p>I felt the design was taking too much attention and the content has
taken a back seat.</p>

<p>There are few good things about this new theme i created:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>More emphasis is given to the content</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Good fonts has been applied and it looks pretty on all devices.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The structure is pretty simple and there are mainly three tabs.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I like it the way it has come up, though some more improvements such as
better responsive navbar and more SEO fields would make it way soon.</p>
